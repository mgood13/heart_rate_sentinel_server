Heart Rate Sentinel Server Project Repository

This server is intended to take in patient information from a program and then store it in a dictionary
that is contained on the server. This allows for continual updating and adjusting by the user. The code can
be run in a manner that is consistent with the one found in the file ServerCall.py. This file is intended
to be used to prime the server to perform the testing. But it also serves as a template.
